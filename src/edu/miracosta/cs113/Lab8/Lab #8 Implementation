// Algorithm to print all items in a Queue using queue operations

 - Can use either poll() or remove() to iterate over items in the Queue
 
 public void printQueue(Queue queue)
 {
 	while(!queue.isEmpty())
 	{	
 		System.out.println(queue.poll());
 	}
 }
 
 
 
 Question 2: s is a Stack<String> and q is a Queue<String>
 
 	Code Fragment Loop 1:
 	
 	String item;				// Create a String Item 
 	while(!s.isEmpty())			// Iterate while the Stack is not empty 
 	{
 		item = s.pop;			// Take the item and remove it from the stack, place it in "item"
 		q.offer(item);			// Place it at the end of the Queue
 	}
 	
 	
 	Code Fragment Loop 2:
 	
 	while(!q.isEmpty())			// Iterate over the Queue while it is not empty 
 	{
 		item = q.remove();		// Remove it from the queue and place it in "item"
 		s.push(item);			// Push it top the top of the stack 
 	}
 	
 	
 	A) After the first loop, the stack is now empty and then the items are put into the stack in the same order
 	B) After the second loop, queue is now empty and the stack is full but the items are in the reverse order 
 		from where they originally started.
