1) If the second/third conditions were evaluated before the first, 
	you may be out of bounds with the (x,y) coordinates. If the 
	third condition is executed before the second, you've failed
	to check whether the current cell has already been visited
	or is part of the barrier.
	

2) The order in which the neighbor cells are tested does not matter,
	and this order will not change the path through the maze.

	
	
3) Yes, Figure 5.19 shows the shortest path to the exit of the maze.
